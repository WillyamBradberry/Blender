Quick Set Blender addon
Useful when a lot of objects in outliner, so just create Quick Set of objects selected to get fast access in fullscreen mode by hit SHIFT+E

A small handy Blender add-on that simplifies working with object sets in a scene. 
Workflow becomes easy and fast â€” a sidebar panel shows a list of object sets.

Each set can be organized to select all the objects within, 
and clicking on an object's button selects it in the scene. 
This is particularly useful for complex scenes where you need to navigate through numerous objects quickly. 
Even if you don't see it. For example you can select dummies in fullscreen mode with Overlays turned off.

The "+" and "-" buttons allow you to add new sets or remove unnecessary objects, significantly speeding up the workflow.

By working with sets via the PIE menu (opened by pressing Shift+E), you can switch between objects or add/remove selected ones from sets. 
The entire process is intuitive, saving you time on complex modeling or animation tasks.
